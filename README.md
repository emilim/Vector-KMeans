# Vector-KMeans
Kmeans on image captured with Anki Vector. Using the SDK from codaris: https://github.com/codaris/Anki.Vector.SDK

This will be implemented in the upcoming full architecture built in C#, as an alternative from Python, to be more efficient and complete.

The idea is then to use my other C++ implementation of afterimages to create a robot that will perceive much more like us humans.
